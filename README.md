# STRENGTH: A Graph Theory-Based Attack Analysis Approach for Security and Robustness Assessment of Smart Home Systems

False data injection (FDI) in smart home sensor measurements can incur increased energy costs and compromise inhabitants' health status. Researchers are developing machine learning (ML)-based efficient anomaly detection models (ADMs) to blend detection-based solid defense strategies into smart home control systems. However, an adversary with adequate system knowledge and computational power can identify backdoors from control models and ADMs to carry out stealthy FDI attacks. Nevertheless, identifying the stealthy attack vectors from ML-based non-linear ADMs is yet to be contemplated. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack analytics leverages formal attack synthesis, which linearizes such ADMs to extract attack vectors. The linearization effort diminishes significant details of the actual ADMs, preventing the identification of a range of critical attack vectors. Moreover, the SOTA framework adopts a window-based optimization approach, thereby producing suboptimal solutions and often failing to provide any solution at all. We propose a novel graph theory-based attack analytics, STRENGTH, which is capable of identifying optimal stealthy attack vectors from a non-linear ADM-supported smart home control system overcoming the limitations of SOTA analytics. We validate our analytics using the SOTA Activity Recognition with Ambient Sensing dataset.
